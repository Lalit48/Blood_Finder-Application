# Blood_Finder-Application
Blood Finder app, as of my last update in January 2022, lacks specific details. For accurate and current information, check official sources or app stores. If you provide details, I can offer more relevant assistance.

This image appears to be a screenshot of a blood donor registration form on a website or application. The form shows the following details filled in by a user:

* Name: Lalit Sudhir Khekale
* Mobile Number: 9322671199
* Email Address: khekalelalit@gmail.com
* Gender: Male
* City: Jalna
  
Additionally, there is a section for blood requesters, which shows that the user has selected blood group "0+" and gender "Female". However, it is unclear whether this section is related to the registration form or not.

Overall, this screenshot suggests that the user is registering as a blood donor, providing their personal details and contact information.

This image appears to be a screenshot of a blood donation request or confirmation page on a website or application. The page shows the following details:
  
* Blood Group: O+
* Request From: Lalit Sudhir Khekale
* Request Off: Blood Doner
* Mobile No.: 9322671199
  
The page also includes two buttons: "ACCEPT" and "REJECT". It seems that the user has selected the "ACCEPT" button, indicating their willingness to donate blood to the blood finder.

Overall, this screenshot suggests that a blood donor (Lalit Sudhir Khekale) has accepted a request for blood donation from a blood finder with blood group O+. The page provides the contact information of the blood donor, which can be used to coordinate the blood donation.
